## Documentation

The module is fully documented in *sphinx* style.


## Installation

Simply download the module and put it either in your project's folder or in
your `$PYTHONPATH`. This will soon be a pypi package that will support easy
installation via `pip`.


### Dependencies

The package is built for Python 2.7.x, and is tested for that version only.

This package is essentialy a wrapper around SciPy's stats package, and uses
some NumPy code as well, so both are critical dependencies. Other than these,
the package uses Python standard libraries only.


## License

Please refer to [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Usage

The reasonable way of using this module is as a python module; that is, with
```python
import drv
```
but see *examples*.
